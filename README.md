# Fujiji
Fujiji is a furniture listing website. Our goal is to provide space for people to effectively and efficiently buy and sell new or used furniture. People can easily browse listings and discover items for sale in their area.

Fujiji is targeted at all people who want to sell their furniture and also people who need furniture, with the main focus on those on a budget. This includes but is not limited to students, newlyweds, working individuals, and local businesses. The efficient price comparisons and negotiable prices on Fujiji accommodate those with a limited budget. By giving a second chance to used furniture, Fujiji would also appeal to those with a sustainable lifestyle.

Sellers can post an ad and choose to boost their ad by purchasing an extra fee. Moreover, users can leave comments and reviews on a listing, and the seller can pick a comment to be highlighted. This allows buyers to be aware of other necessary information about the listing. Buyers can also have a private conversation with the sellers via our chat feature. For convenience, buyers can tailor their search results to their needs with the filter and sort function. Additionally, Fujiji has an online payment option for fast transactions.
